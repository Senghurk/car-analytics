# Project01 - Car Analytics

## Overview
This is a web application built using React.js. It utilizes React Routing for navigation and Local Storage for data persistence. The app operates without a backend, instead relying on data provided through a JSON file.

## Key Features
* **React.js**: The app is built using the React.js library, providing a robust and efficient front-end framework.
* **React Routing**: Navigation within the app is handled by React Routing, enabling a smooth, single-page application experience.
* **Local Storage**: Data persistence is achieved through the use of the browser's Local Storage, allowing the app to maintain state between sessions.
* **No Backend**: This app operates entirely on the client-side, with no server-side components.
* **JSON Data Source**: All data used in the application is sourced from a provided JSON file.
* **Data Visualization**: The app uses Chart.js to create interactive and responsive charts:
   * A pie chart showing the proportion of cars by brand
   * A stacked bar chart displaying the models of each brand
